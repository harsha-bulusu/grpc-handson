**four phases**:

1. **Foundations & Origin** – understand why gRPC exists, how it evolved, and its core building blocks.
2. **Core gRPC Mechanics** – get fluent in all API types, serialization, and service contracts.
3. **Industry Patterns & Architecture** – learn real-world service design, security, scaling, and monitoring.
4. **Advanced Prototyping & Polyglot Systems** – implement cross-language systems, optimize performance, and handle production-grade concerns.

## **PHASE 1 – Foundations & Origins** (Context & Fundamentals)

**Goal:** Understand *why* gRPC exists, its place in distributed systems, and the problems it solves.

### Topics:

* **History & Evolution**

  * RPC in general — from ONC RPC → CORBA → SOAP → REST → gRPC.
  * Google's internal Stubby RPC framework → public gRPC.
  * Why REST+JSON isn’t always enough.
* **Core Concepts**

  * Protocol Buffers (Proto3) as Interface Definition Language (IDL).
  * HTTP/2 framing & multiplexing.
  * Binary serialization vs JSON text serialization.
  * Cross-language interoperability.
* **When to Use & When Not to Use gRPC**

  * Low-latency microservices.
  * Streaming APIs.
  * IoT & mobile.
  * Why gRPC is bad for browser-only clients (unless using gRPC-Web).

**Hands-On Prototypes:**

* Create your first `.proto` file defining a simple "Greeter" service.
* Generate server & client stubs in two languages (e.g., Python & Java).
* Call across languages.

## **PHASE 2 – Core gRPC Mechanics** (Fluency in gRPC APIs)

**Goal:** Be comfortable with every type of gRPC call, how messages are serialized, and the runtime execution flow.

### Topics:

1. **gRPC API Types**

   * Unary RPC.
   * Server streaming.
   * Client streaming.
   * Bidirectional streaming.
2. **Serialization**

   * How Proto3 encodes data.
   * Required/optional/repeated fields.
   * Backward/forward compatibility rules.
3. **Flow & Lifecycle**

   * Stub creation.
   * Connection lifecycle.
   * Deadlines, cancellations, and retries.
4. **Error Handling**

   * gRPC status codes vs HTTP status codes.
   * Custom error payloads.
5. **Metadata & Headers**

   * Sending/receiving metadata.
   * Authentication tokens in metadata.

**Hands-On Prototypes:**

* Implement all four API types.
* Add deadlines & cancellation handling.
* Send custom metadata between services.
* Introduce breaking changes in `.proto` and test compatibility.

## **PHASE 3 – Industry Patterns & Architecture** (How the pros design)

**Goal:** Learn how gRPC is used in real-world systems at scale.

### Topics:

1. **Service Design Patterns**

   * Request-response aggregation service.
   * Fan-out/fan-in with streaming.
   * Real-time notifications via server-streaming.
2. **Security**

   * TLS in gRPC.
   * mTLS (Mutual TLS) for service-to-service auth.
   * Token-based auth (JWT, OAuth2).
3. **Load Balancing**

   * Client-side vs server-side LB.
   * Service discovery (with Consul, Kubernetes, etc.).
4. **Observability**

   * Interceptors for logging & metrics.
   * Prometheus & OpenTelemetry tracing.
5. **Error Budgeting & Retries**

   * Retry policies in gRPC.
   * Circuit breaker patterns.
6. **Versioning Strategies**

   * Proto evolution without breaking clients.
7. **Integration with REST**

   * gRPC-Gateway (HTTP/JSON ↔ gRPC).
   * Coexisting with REST APIs.

**Hands-On Prototypes:**

* Build a "microservice trio" with one aggregator service that calls two others using gRPC.
* Implement TLS + mTLS between them.
* Add an interceptor that logs requests and metrics to Prometheus.
* Use gRPC-Gateway to expose your service to REST clients.

## **PHASE 4 – Advanced Prototyping & Polyglot Systems** (Architect-Level Skills)

**Goal:** Be able to design & run production-grade, language-agnostic gRPC systems.

### Topics:

1. **Polyglot Systems**

   * Sharing `.proto` contracts across teams in multiple languages.
   * Client codegen automation in CI/CD.
2. **Streaming at Scale**

   * Flow control in HTTP/2.
   * Backpressure handling.
   * Large message handling.
3. **Resilience & Scalability**

   * Horizontal scaling in Kubernetes.
   * Load testing with `ghz` or `fortio`.
4. **Debugging**

   * Using `grpcurl` for testing.
   * Inspecting HTTP/2 frames with Wireshark.
5. **Performance Tuning**

   * Serialization optimizations.
   * Channel pooling.
   * Thread & connection tuning.
6. **Hybrid Systems**

   * gRPC in event-driven architectures (Kafka → gRPC bridge).
   * gRPC + GraphQL patterns.

**Hands-On Prototypes:**

* Build a polyglot microservices system (e.g., Go service ↔ Java service ↔ Python client).
* Implement bidirectional streaming for a real-time chat.
* Add Kubernetes deployment with service discovery.
* Run load tests, tweak performance, and compare results.
* Debug a failing request using `grpcurl` + Wireshark.

## **Suggested Learning Flow & Timeline**

If you dedicate **2–3 weeks per phase** with deep prototyping:

* **Phase 1** – Week 1–2
* **Phase 2** – Week 3–4
* **Phase 3** – Week 5–7
* **Phase 4** – Week 8–10
  By the end of \~10 weeks, you’ll be fully capable of building and architecting gRPC systems like a seasoned pro.

If you want, I can make you a **visual map** of this curriculum that shows how we go from “origin” → “basics” → “patterns” → “advanced” in a single diagram. That way you can treat it like a road map for your gRPC learning journey.

Do you want me to prepare that next?
